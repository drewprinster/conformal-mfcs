Code for multistep feedback covariate shift conformal prediction experiments in "Conformal Validity Guarantees Exist for Any Data Distribution" (ICML 2024)

Note: I am currently in the process of improving the usability and clarity of this code repository. I aim to have updates and complete documentation soon, likely June 2024.
