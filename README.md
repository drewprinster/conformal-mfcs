# conformal-mfcs
Code for multistep feedback covariate shift conformal prediction experiments in [Conformal Validity Guarantees Exist for Any Data Distribution (and How to Find Them)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06627) (ICML 2024).

The folder `bash_scripts` contains example scripts for running the experiments (setup for a slurm workload manager). Alternatively, `results` contains CSV files for the experimental results reported in the paper, and the provided Jupyter notebooks are for plotting these results to produce the paper's figures.

Note: On June 28th, 2024 I substantially updated this repository to clean and improve the clarity of the code, but I plan to continue updating it for further useability and more extensive documentation throughout July prior to ICML 2024. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me at **drew@cs.jhu.edu** with any questions, and I'll do my best to reply promptly. Thank you for your interest!
